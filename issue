I 'm excited working with you but the agency seemed to have difficulties meeting requirements before hiring me. 

In regards of training plan, I found some issues on section 5, which shows training plan details:

[Student role] "her roles includes knowledge in strateic capital analysis (CCAR, AML, Basel), balance sheet, hedging strategies, compliance policy and risk consultancy in liquidity risk, credit risks, market risks and operational risks." This is not role description created for this position, but a copy& paste directly from my resume. These are my skills, but not all related to STEM field, neither nor all related to this specific position. 

[Goals and objectives] The question requires objectives to gain"specific knowledge, skills or techniques", but this is not mentioned in the answer. "How to achieve the object" wasn't mentioned, either.

[Employer oversight] This part requires "how employer provide oversight", you only mentioned the name of supervisor, but no answer to "how". Also, no traininig program mentioned either.

[Measures and assessments] Similarly, not detailed answer to the question "How to measure performance".Also, no traininig program mentioned either.



In summary, no detailed training plan but many boilplate sentences found. I don't believe school/government will approve the employment based on description like this. 

Also, do you have difficulties answer the questions below? I mentioned it in previous email and asked in the previous phone call but I never received any responses to them.
